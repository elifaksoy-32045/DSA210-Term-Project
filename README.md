# DSA210-Term-Project
## Description
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.
This project will be an analysis on my Spotify listening habits and summer 2024 gym routine.

## Motivation
While brainstorming project ideas, I realized that two activities heavily influence my daily life: listening to music on Spotify and following my gym routine. During the summer of 2024, I had a consistent gym routine, making it an ideal period to analyze. After school starts, my gym routine becomes irregular, so I decided to focus solely on my summer data.

This project aims to analyze my Spotify music history and gym routine data from the summer of 2024 to uncover insights into how my choice of music—such as energetic or calm tracks—aligns with different aspects of my gym activities. Through data visualization and analysis, I hope to understand how music impacts my workouts and potentially optimize my playlists for better performance.

## Data Sources
### Spotify Music History

The primary source of my music data comes from Spotify, which includes:

-  Tracks I listened to (title, artist, and album).
-  Time of playback.
-  Audio features of the tracks (energy, tempo, danceability, etc.) obtained using Spotify’s Web API.
  
### Gym Routine

The gym-related data will be manually logged and will include:

-  Dates and times of gym sessions.
-  Types of exercises performed (e.g., cardio, weightlifting).
-  Duration and intensity of workouts.

This manually collected data will serve as a key part of the analysis, providing insights into workout patterns and their relationship to music preferences.
